**How Much Work Can We Squeeze from Heat?**

**Introduction: The Quest to Extract Work from Heat**

What if you could turn every bit of heat into useful work?

This simple yet profound question lies at the heart of thermodynamics.
Whether you're driving a car, flying a jet, or generating power in a
steam turbine, the goal is the same: extract as much useful work as
possible from a given amount of heat.

But how much is actually possible?

This article explores that question using theoretical insights and
simulations, walking through symbolic and numerical modeling of three
fundamental heat engines --- **Carnot, Otto**, and **Diesel**. You'll
also learn how to build your own simulator to explore the limits imposed
by nature.

**Understanding the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics**

**The First Law: Energy Conservation in Heat Engines**

The First Law of Thermodynamics is essentially an energy balance:

**ΔU = Q + W**

Where:

ΔU is the change in internal energy

Q is the heat added to the system

W is the work done by the system

This law tells us energy is never lost --- it only changes form. But it
doesn't tell us how much of that heat becomes useful work.

**The Second Law: Entropy and Limitations**

The Second Law introduces a hard truth: not all heat can be converted
into work.

**ΔS~universe~≥ 0**

In a heat engine:

Heat enters from a hot source

Some is converted to work

The rest is expelled to a cold sink

This unavoidable loss limits the maximum efficiency of any real engine.

**The Carnot Engine: Theoretical Efficiency Limit**

**Deriving Carnot Efficiency**

The Carnot cycle is the ideal, reversible heat engine. Its efficiency is
given by:

**η~Carnot~ = 1 -- (T~C~ / T~H~)**

Where:

η~Carnot~ is the efficiency

T~H~ is the temperature of the hot reservoir (in Kelvin)

T~C~ is the temperature of the cold reservoir (in Kelvin)

![](media/image1.jpeg){width="5.6in" height="3.7152777777777777in"}

This equation defines the upper limit --- no real engine can be more
efficient due to irreversibilities.

**Entropy Flow in the Carnot Cycle**

In a Carnot engine:

Q~H~ is heat absorbed from the hot source

Q~C~ is heat rejected to the cold sink

Work done is:

**W = Q~H~-- Q~C~ = ΔS × (T~H~ -- T~C~)**

Entropy is conserved in this ideal case: there's no net generation.

**Otto Cycle: Modeling the Gasoline Engine**

**Process Overview**

The Otto cycle (used in spark ignition engines) consists of:

1\. Adiabatic compression

2\. Isochoric (constant volume) heat addition

3\. Adiabatic expansion

4\. Isochoric heat rejection

height="2.6819444444444445in"}**Efficiency of the Otto Cycle**

**η~Otto~ = 1 -- (1 / r^γ -- 1^)**

Where:

r is the compression ratio

γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv)

**Efficiency vs Compression Ratio**

Plotting efficiency against compression ratio reveals diminishing
returns --- after a certain point, increasing compression yields minimal
gains due to knocking limits.

**Diesel Cycle: Heat Addition at Constant Pressure**

**Diesel Efficiency Equation**

Diesel engines add heat at constant pressure. Their efficiency is given
by:

**η~Diesel~ = 1 -- (1 / r^γ -- 1^) × \[(ρ^γ^-1) / γ(ρ -- 1)\]**

Where:

ρ is the cut-off ratio (V~3~ / V~2~)

![](media/image4.jpeg){width="4.104861111111111in"
height="2.9555555555555557in"}

Diesel engines allow higher compression ratios without knocking, making
them more efficient in heavy-duty applications.

**Building a Thermodynamic Simulator**

You can build your own simulator using:

Python: with NumPy, Matplotlib, SymPy

MATLAB/Simulink

GeoGebra (browser-based for beginners)

Your simulator can let users adjust:

Reservoir temperatures

Compression ratios

Specific heats

Cut-off volumes

**Visualizing Thermodynamic Cycles**

**Step-by-Step: P-V and T-S Diagrams**

1\. Define states using ideal gas relations

2\. Plot P-V diagram

![](media/image5.jpeg){width="4.00625in" height="2.68125in"}

3\. Plot T-S diagram

![](media/image6.jpeg){width="4.51875in" height="2.9993055555555554in"}

Label areas for heat input, heat rejection, and net work.

**Comparing Engine Efficiencies**

By plotting:

η\<sub\>Otto\</sub\>, η\<sub\>Diesel\</sub\>, η\<sub\>Carnot\</sub\> vs
Compression Ratio (r)

You'll find:

Otto flattens early due to knocking

Diesel performs better under pressure

Carnot remains ideal --- never surpassed

height="2.8930555555555557in"}

**Entropy Generation and Work Output**

Real engines generate entropy:

Carnot: no net entropy (ideal)

Otto & Diesel: positive entropy from combustion, friction, and heat loss

Work output:

W\<sub\>net\</sub\> = Area enclosed on P-V diagram

**Symbolic vs Numeric Computation of Work**

**Symbolic (SymPy)**

Use:

W = ∫\<sub\>V₁\</sub\>\<sup\>V₂\</sup\> P(V) dV

For adiabatic processes:

P(V) = P₁ × (V₁ / V)^γ^

**Numeric (NumPy/Scipy)**

Use:

Discrete P-V data from simulation

np.trapz() or scipy.integrate.simps()

Compare to ideal values

| Engine Efficiency Net Work (kJ) Entropy Gen (J/K) |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
| Carnot 50% 100 0                                  |
| Otto 45% 95 10                                    |
| Diesel 48% 98 8                                   |

**Limitations of Real Engines**

Real-world issues lower efficiency:

Friction

Combustion delay

Valve imperfections

Heat transfer lags

Even the best materials can\'t match Carnot because real engines must
run at finite speed.

limits.

**Q3. Why are Diesel engines more efficient?**

A: They use constant-pressure heat addition and higher compression.

**Q4. How is entropy related to work?**

A: More entropy = more waste. Less entropy = more usable energy.

**Q6. How do I visualize engine cycles?**

A: Use P-V and T-S diagrams. Work is the area inside the cycle.

**Conclusion: Powering More Than Machines**

Growing up in Cameroon, I've spent countless nights without electricity
--- scribbling notes by candlelight and solving equations under fading
flashlight beams. Those quiet outages weren't just inconveniences; they
were questions waiting to be answered. Questions like: How can we design
engines that waste less? How can we build systems that serve more people
with less fuel?

This article, and the simulations behind it, are part of my personal
pursuit to turn those questions into action. Through thermodynamics,
symbolic math, and open-source modeling, I've learned how energy flows,
where it escapes, and how we can harness it more wisely. Each diagram,
each line of Python code, brings me closer to a future where efficient,
sustainable energy systems are the norm --- not the exception.

I may not have all the answers yet. But I'm building the tools to ask
better questions --- and to power not just machines, but lives.
